Variation
---------

### Glyphs

- all lowercase glyphs with ascenders
- all `top` anchors of lowercase glyphs

### Shape

- extends ascender

### Widths

- same as default

## Anchors

- same as default

exception:

- all `top` anchors of lowercase glyphs move up/down to increase/decrease distance between base glyph and diacritic


Workflow
--------

### GF

- select and move points / anchors


Issues
------

- apostrophe in `napostrophe` not moving up, construction needs to use anchor
- cyrillic ascenders appear longer in relation to roman
