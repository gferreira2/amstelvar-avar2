Variation
---------

### Glyphs

all glyphs with exceptions:

- thin (single stroke) glyphs: i l I etc.
- dots, bars, etc: .,:;!

### Widths

- character widths change with glyph shape
- rule: sidebearings same as default

## Anchors

- some anchors are positioned proportionally (top, bottom, center)


Workflow

Notes
-----

- some glyphs scale different than others
- in practice: adjust values for special cases
