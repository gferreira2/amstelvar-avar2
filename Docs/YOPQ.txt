Notes
-----

### YOPQ vs. YSHL / YSHU

the serif height axis currently controls a few things which are not serifs:

- details of brackets, braces
- tail of J j / Italic descenders g f j

### YOPQ + XOPQ combined

glyphs in which the weight change is split between XOPQ & YOPQ axes

- S s g
- A V v W w (apex)
- section
