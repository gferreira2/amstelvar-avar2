minimum
: 4

maximum
: 310


Variation
---------

### Glyphs

rule:

- all glyphs with a thick stroke

exceptions:

- ?

### Shape

- internal whitespace (XTRA) does not change in closed glyphs
- in open glyphs, internal whitespace is adjusted to harmonize with widths of closed glyphs

### Widths

- rule: sidebearings same as default
- (exceptions?)

### Anchors

- some anchors are positioned proportionally (center stroke, ogonek)
- some anchors remain attached to contour points (cyrillic descender)

### Sub-axes

- `XOLC
- `XOUC
- `XOFI


Workflow
--------

### GF

- select and shift points until measurement value matches target min/max
- import default in the background
- isolate parts of contour and scale to match foreground
- reposition foreground points based on scaled curve in the background 


Issues
------

### Width compensation

- glyphs with 


### Tapering

- remove tapering in XTRA min? (currently inconsistent)
