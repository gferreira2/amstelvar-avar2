XOPQ
====


Variation
---------

### Glyphs

- all glyphs with a thick stroke

### Widths

- rule: sidebearings same as default
- (exceptions?)

### Shape

- internal whitespace (XTRA) does not change in closed glyphs
- in open glyphs, internal whitespace is adjusted to harmonize with widths of closed glyphs

### Anchors

- some anchors are positioned proportionally (center stroke, ogonek)
- some anchors remain attached to contour points (cyrillic descender)


Workflow
--------

- shift points until measurement snaps
- import default in the background
- isolate parts of contour and scale to match foreground
- reposition foreground points based on scaled curve in the background 


Notes
-----

### Tapering

- keep tapering in XTRA min? (currently inconsistent)
