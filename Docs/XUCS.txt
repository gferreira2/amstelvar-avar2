Variation
---------

### Glyphs

- all glyphs except `space`

### Widths

- all glyph widths change except `space` 

### Anchors

- rule: same position in relation to the contours


Workflow
--------

- start with `H`
- propagate new margins to all members of left/right kerning groups (using GroupSpacing extension)
- continue with all other glyphs

- test intermediate results in Fontra
- test effect on width and optical size axes
